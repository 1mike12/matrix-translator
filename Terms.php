                            We're just trying to provide a simple service to a simple, albeit frustrating problem. Our lawyers told us to say that we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the output, although it's pretty much safe to say that what you enter will generate a legitimate output. If you are doing stuff like building bridges over the Tacoma Narrows or calculating martian re-entry, you shouldn't rely on our output. That's too much responsibility man.

                            You are free to use Matrix Translator for homework, writing publications and anything else that suits your fancy. If you are a rocket scientist or win a nobel prize while using our services, you should give us a shoutout. Or like $50. I know those swedes give you money.
