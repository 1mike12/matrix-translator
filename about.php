                        <div>I got the inspiration to make the matrix translator while (surprise) taking a linear algebra class. In class, we had to use matlab, but we all used WolframAlpha when it was time to do homework since nobody had a matlab license. Between memorizing eigen' this and eigen' that, there was no room left in my brain to remember the finicky syntax between each program. I found myself spending 5-10 minutes every single time I did my homework to re-look up how to write the code.</div>
