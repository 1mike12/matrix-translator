                        <h2>Matrix Translator automatically formats a matrix to be copied and pasted into 3rd party websites and programs.</h2>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The inspiration for developing Matrix Translator came when Mike took a linear algebra class. He wasted a lot of time remembering the complex syntax between each of the programs and websites out there. Thus, the original idea for Matrix Translator was born!</p>

                            <p>Jquery is used heavily to enable functionality; from the sliding accordion effect that you see on this very page, to the actual code crunching going on behind the scenes. </p>

                        <div class="accordionContent">
                            <p>The matrix conversion algorithm was created using javscript and the jQuery language. When you click out of any of the fields, your browser automatically generates an internal array which represents the visual table that you see. Then, through a series of translation functions, the correct output is pieced together for each respective language.</p>
